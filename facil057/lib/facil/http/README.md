# The HTTP / Websocket extensions.

**Notice**: these extensions require the core `facil.io` library as well as the `bscrypt` extension (for SipHash and Base64 functionality). Websockets will also require the `pubsub` service and (in the future) the `redis_client` service.

These are extensions that allow `facil.io` to easily implement HTTP and Websocket services. Please read the project's [README.md](../../README.md) for more details, or visit [facil.io's website](http://facil.io).
